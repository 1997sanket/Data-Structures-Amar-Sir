1. Hashing is used for speeding the process of accessing data.

2. Example in our Mobile phones, when we save a contact it is saved by an unique 'key'. Whenever that person
   calls us, according to the number(key) the contact is searched in the phone and we see their name and maybe
   picture.

3. There are various ways of implementing hashing concept.
 	a) Direct hashing (rollno and name of student)		b) Subraction and many more


4. Hash collision can occur when on the same key, there are multiple records. 

5. Solutions : a)Probing b)Bucketing c)Chaining

A) Probing :

Like a parking lot, if not found space go to next. Drawback is lots of searching and thus slowing down.


B) Bucketing : 

We make a 2D array. For eg for 10 keys, we will make 10x10 array, new records come if not available in the
first index, shift to next. But the drawback is memory.


C) Chaining : 

Similar to Bucketing but we use linked lists. So dynamic memory allocation. But drawback is, it can be complex
