1. Graph is basically a cyclic tree.

2. Graph is a superset of Tree. So every Tree is a Graph. 

3. There are various applocations of Graphs. Eg : Google maps, Social networking where each user is a node,
   Minimum spanning tree(Extracting a tree from graph, maybe to broadcast message to all the nodes), 
   Mobile finger pattern lock, Network connections, Transport, Wiring, Piping, etc.

4. Graphs are programmatically represented as Adjency matrix or Adjency list. Adj Matrix is the most commonly
   used. 

5. BFS, DFS and A-star are search algorithms. We can use them to search some data in a Graph. A-star is the 
   best one amongst them.

6. MST is extracting a tree from a graph having minimum cost edges. Algorithms for doing these are 
   Kruskal's algo and Prim's algo.

7. Dijiktra's algo is used for finding shortest distance from one node to all other nodes.

8. Floyd Warshall is used for finding shortest path from all the sources.
